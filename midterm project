#This assignment I would love to find the relation among Poisson, Exponential and Gamma Distribution

#Definition of three distributions:
#Poisson distribution is often referred to as the "distribution of rare events". It is also the distribution for count data.
#Exponential distribution is the probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process.
#Gamma Distribution Gamma distribution arises naturally in processes for which the waiting times between events are relevant.

#set lambda = 5

#Histogram with curve of exponential distribution at lambda=5

x.gen <- rexp(1000, rate = 5)
hist(x.gen, prob = TRUE)
x.est <- fitdistr(x.gen, "exponential")$estimate
x.est
curve(dexp(x, rate = x.est), add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 2)

#Histogram with curve of poisson distribution at lambda=5
y.gen <- rpois(1000,5)
hist(y.gen, prob = TRUE)
y.est <- fitdistr(y.gen, "poisson")$estimate

#??Remaining problem:This command gives me appropriate result, but how to set from and to is a problem
#??How to set the boundaries and how to make it work as the exponential curve shown above?
curve(dpois(x,y.est), add = TRUE, col = "red", from=0,to= 12,n=13)

#??Remaining question: For poisson and exponential distribution with lambda =5
#??What is the respective value of k and theta in gamma distribution?



#Rewrite the code:

# parameter:
#   typ: the type of distribution, c("exp", "poi", "gam")
#   lam: the common parameter in exp. poi. and gamma distribution.
#   rep: length of samples.
#   exp.max: threshold of sum of exponential random samples, when getting expo. samples.
#   poi.max: length of given time interval in a poisson process.
#   gam.alpha: the first parameter of gamma distribution, number of exponential variables.
# return:
#   a sample vector
