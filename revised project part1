#This assignment I would love to find the relation among Poisson, Exponential and Gamma Distribution

#Definition of three distributions:
#Poisson distribution is often referred to as the "distribution of rare events". It is also the distribution for count data.
#Exponential distribution is the probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process.
#Gamma Distribution arises naturally in processes for which the waiting times between events are relevant.

#Zhuojin Lyu -- It's a wonderful idea to visualize the sample graph and compare it with the one
#discribing the random points from possion distribution. But it's  better to use lambda = 45 possion 
#distribution otherwise the x-axis ranges are different in these two graphs.
#that is,
#y.gen <- rpois(1000,45)
#mean(y.gen)
#var(y.gen)
#Zhuojin Lyu



#As we can see from the mean and the variance, the mean and the variance of the sample
#is 45.355 and 46.041 which is close to the mean and variance of poisson distribution 
#with n=9 and lambda=5, which has both mean and variance equal to 9*5=45.
#Also from comparison, the two graphs from different samples are pretty much alike.
#Then we can conclude that the number of events divided by exponential waiting times are Poisson distributed.

#I want to show that the number of events divided by exponential waiting times are Poisson distributed.
