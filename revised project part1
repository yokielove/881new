#This assignment I would love to find the relation among Poisson, Exponential and Gamma Distribution

#Definition of three distributions:
#Poisson distribution is often referred to as the "distribution of rare events". It is also the distribution for count data.
#Exponential distribution is the probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process.
#Gamma Distribution Gamma distribution arises naturally in processes for which the waiting times between events are relevant.

#I want to show that the number of events divided by exponential waiting times are Poisson distributed.

#As we can see from the mean and the variance, the mean and the variance of the sample
#is 45.355 and 46.041 which is close to the mean and variance of poisson distribution 
#with n=9 and lambda=5, which has both mean and variance equal to 9*5=45.
#Also from comparison, the two graphs from different samples are pretty much alike.
#Then we can conclude that the number of events divided by exponential waiting times are Poisson distributed.

#As we can see from the mean and the variance, the mean and the variance of the sample
